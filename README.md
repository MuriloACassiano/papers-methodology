We built this code to generate a negative dataset allowing us to assess the available promoter prediction toolsâ€™ capacity to distinguish real promoters from random sequences and, because, to the best of our knowledge, there are no experimentally-validated negative promoters datasets available. This code allows its user to generate sequences with a nucleotide distribution similar to that encountered in a given input fasta file (in our case, 865 promoter sequences, present in Regulon DB - see the preprint).
